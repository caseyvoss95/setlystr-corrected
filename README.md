Getting Started
--

Try it out for yourself at [here](https://setlystr.herokuapp.com/setlist). New songs can be added to the musician's known repertoire (a feature that will eventually only be available from a seperate dashboard), and then subsequently be added to the client's desired setlist.


Future Enhancements
--
* Add client and musician authentication.
* Create a private dashboard for the musician.
* Link a music player to sample chosen repertoire.
